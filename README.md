The course provides an introduction to methods and issues in modern statistical physics with emphasis on algorithmic and computational methods. The applications and the computational methods are relevant for e.g. materials science, complex systems, chemistry, solid state, molecular and biophysics.

The course focuses on building an understanding of the macroscopic effects of microscopic interactions in numerical studies of microscopic models closely related to the development of a relevant theoretical framework.

The course provides an introduction to the most central numerical methods in atomic modeling, algorithmic modeling of disordered systems, and in discrete models for liquids, including:

Atomic and molecular dynamics in different ensembles, thermostats, fluctuations, connection to continuum models.
Confusion migrations: renormalization, scaling and fractals.
Percolation: Finite-size scaling; Cluster and subset geometry; Renormalization.
Disordered systems: Diffusion, transport and mechanical properties of disordered systems; Dynamic processes in disordered systems; and Growth processes far from equilibrium.
Discrete liquid models: Grid-gas models, Dissipative - Particle Dynamics, and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics.
